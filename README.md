# Eventor GraphQL API

This project aims on exposing the [Eventor API](https://eventor.orienteering.org/api/documentation) as a GraphQL API.

Current GraphQL playground is available here: https://eventor-graphql-api-mikaello.vercel.app/api/graphql ,
this is currently tied to the Norwegian API, and you need to bring your own ApiKey (add it to the _HTTP HEADERS_
section).
